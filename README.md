# web-development-bootcamp-practice-code
This repository contains my practice work from The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp Course by Angela Yu

## Structure
- `frontend/` → HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM exercises.
- `backend/` → Node.js, Express, and other server-side practice.

These are purely for learning purposes and not intended as portfolio-ready projects.
